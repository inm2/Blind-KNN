For this project, I am trying to determine the classification accuracy of distance between a RFID reader (transmitter) and an RFID tag (receiver), based on the data used for the project. \n",

    "The project was designed by setting up an antenna connected to an RFID reader along different points in a 28 sq ft grid. The RFID reader received backscattered RSSI data from a passive RFID tag, which was placed in a fixed location. The antenna was mounted to a rotating platform. The antenna transmits and receives in 30-degree intervals. Once the antenna was rotated along a 360-degree interval, the antenna was moved to the next point in the grid and the process is then repeated. Once the data was cleaned, overall, 16,183 data points were able to be used for the algorithm.\n",
